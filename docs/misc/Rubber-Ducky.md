It's a rubber ducky ! It's cute ! Tell it all about your code and maybe you'll solve something.

It squeaks if you right click with it or on it. It also squeaks with a redstone signal, it's a very chatty little guy.

## Customization

You can dye it in a crafting table similarly to how you'd dye leather armor. Use multiple dyes to get the exact color you want. You can reset it by clicking on a water cauldron with it. You can also name it in an anvil if you'd like.
